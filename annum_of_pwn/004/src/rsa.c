We need the following values in order to perform a basic RSA encryption:
p, q, e, d

p and q are both prime integers, these seeds are the foundation of RSA
p   - prime
q   - prime

n formula, n is known as the modulus/modulo, and also the key size in RSA:
n = p * q

totient of n fomula:
O(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

e   = public key exponent(exponent)
d   = private key exponent(private value)

e
the value of "e" needs to be between 1, and the totient of n
the greatest common divisor of "e", has to be 1

d
d = inverse(e) mod o(n)
d equals the inverse of e, modulo the totient of n
we can derive the value of d, from the extended euclidean algorithm

functions we need to write:
inverse()
ext_euclidean_algo()
totient_of_n()

each of our keys will be represented as integer pairs
private key (d, n)
public key  (e, n)

encryption algorithm:
plaintext ** e % n
plaintext to the power of e, modulo of n

decryption algorithm:
encrypted ** d % n
encrypted to the power of d, modulo of n

lets take this for example:

p=11            ; prime int
q=13            ; prime int

n=143           ; p * q ; n == 143
PHI=totient(n)  ; 120 ; totient of n ; O(n) ; not big O notation btw

e=7             ; must be between 1 and totent of n
d=103           ; inverse(e) mod o(n)

pub(7,143)      ; (e,n)
prv(103, 143)   ; (d,n)
