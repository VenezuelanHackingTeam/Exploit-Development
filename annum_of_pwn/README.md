# year of pwn
This is a challenge i am setting for myself, the date today is 4/12/2021, and i will complete 1 unique
pwn challenge every single day.

I hope to keep the difficulty of these challenges at the point where it is almost barely doable.
With each of these binaries, i hope to learn a new concept or technique that accompanies them.
Obviously, after around 1-2 months we begin to run out of concepts or techniques that exist out there,
but for this challenge i am not limiting myself to ctf challenges exclusively. I hope to also include
challenges from different platforms, and 1day POC's of existing CVE's.

I am just setting this as a baseline to get me to work my hardest everyday and i hope to document it here
