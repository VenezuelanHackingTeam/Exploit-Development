# pwnable.kr - syscall
exploiting a custom syscall :)

when we ssh, we are presented with a kernel object with the name of o. I am assuming that this
already exists within this system. Something that should also be noted is that this system's
architecture is 32 bit armv7l, which means we may need some knowledge on the differences between each
of these architectures.

in this case, we are still on a linux system, so everything is essentially the same besides the
wacky architecture. Our new system call is call sys_upper, and we are provided the source code to the
system call implemented within the remote system, and the kernel object file.

it seems as though sys_upper will convert a string to upper case. I do not see why a kernel would need
such a capability but this is a fun introduction to kernel exploitation so i guess it makes sense.

it will allow 2 parameters from userspace, char* in and char* out. an input string and an output
string, this is something that should not be used, never take unchecked input from userland!!

it should be noted, that it will write what we want, to whereever we want it to. we might be able
to provide a pointer to some area in memory with in, and it will write it to out, but we can make
out point to wherever we want it to.

sys_upper(number : 223) is added

cool, so we have syscall 223, sys_upper

if we were to "cat /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict", we will be able to notice that it has been disabled.
This means that we are allowed to resolve kernel symbols from userspace, which means we are allowed
to access names, which point to a location in memory that corresponds to that name(symbol).

So we know we have a write what where primitive within ring 0, but where to?

lets take a step back and inspect the internals in how the kernel will translate, resolve, and
interpret each of our system calls. How will our kernel understand what to do after a system call
is called? These syscalls work as a sort of API for the operating system on the lowest level, there
will be certain calling conventions for different platforms, but with linux x86/x86_64 it will
almost always be exclusive to cdecl

x86:
eax      - syscall
ebx      - parameter 1
ecx      - parameter 2
edx      - parameter 3
int 0x80 - interrupt

x86_64:
rax      - syscall
rdi      - parameter 1
rsi      - parameter 2
rdx      - parameter 3
syscall  - interrupt

that is the convention in which parameters are passed to not only functions, but to system
calls as well. Now we understand how to pass and call system calls!, but how will the kernel
understand? The kernel faces the same dillema as dynamic binaries, in which it does not know
where in memory their function, or in this case, module will be loaded. In the userland, we have
the Global Offset Table, Procedure Linkage Table, and __dl_runtime_resolve, but what about the
kernel? If it were to follow the same process as userland dynamic binaries, that would cause
MASSIVE security issues.

So kernel modules will run within it's own virtual memory, and this may seem a bit confusing at
first until we remember that the kernel IS A PROGRAM that will run underneath the operating system
or at least our userland interface. Since it is a program, it will have inspectable memory mappings
that we can view or modify, since everythin is a file in linux.

when we check the remote system's /proc/kallsyms, which contains all the kernel's symbols, and the
symbols from each module that had been imported when the kernel booted. Something that should be noted
is that we now know where each of these functions reside in memory, which will allow us to view
what functions we think are tasty. This however will not work if KASLR is enabled, but luckily it
has been turned off, so we can hardcode addresses instead of dynamically resolving them.
At least i think so..

So now that we understand the vulnerablilties that are within this system call, we can begin to
attempt to priv esc to ring 0. 

1. KASLR is off, and we can view symbols of virtual kernel space, define important addresses like our
system call table, our sys_upper syscall, and our two system calls that will allow us to retain our
priviledges, commit_creds and prepare_kernel_cred
2. write NOPS to a area of writeable memory
3. write commit_creds to the 25th index of SYS_CALL_TABLE
4. write prepare_kernel_cred to 13th index of SYS_CALL_TABLE
5. update our cred table and return peacefully with "syscall(25,syscall(13,0));"
6. We now have root perms, we can do whatever we want now!
