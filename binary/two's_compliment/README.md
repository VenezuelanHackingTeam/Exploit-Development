0001    1        1
0010    2        2
0011    3        3
0100    4        4
0101    5        5
0110    6        6
0111    7        7
1000    8        8
1001    9        9
1010    A        10
1011    B        11

the signed bit is the first bit

00010100 == 20 == 0x14

the as the first bit represents the fact that it is a positive value

00000101 == 5

this is due to each bit essentially representing a different value
```
128 64  32  16  8   4   2   1
0   0   0   0   0   1   0   1
```
nice we can read positive values, but what about negative ones?

for negative values, the signed bit(first bit) will be a 1, which tells us the value is negative

in this case, 128 will not become the value of 128, it will only server to tell us that this

value is negative
```
10000101 == -5

the same goes for bytes(4 bits)
0101    ==  5
1101    == -5
```
important to know how many bits you are working with!

binary arithmetic:

this should basically be the same as normal decimal arithmetic
except we only have 1's and 0's, but each place will represent a value

it will be the same value, just the format will be different
```
0101    == 5
        +
0001    == 1
------------
0110    =  6
```
decimal values are represented by 4 bytes, which is 32 bits

if the maximum value of a signed int is 2,147,483,647, then 32 bits should be able to represent that

let me try.

signed two's compliment:

01111111111111111111111111111111

well it looks like i got it, sure took such a long time

now we can actually perform more complicated arithmetic since we can represent values larger than 7 now

lets try multiplication
```
0 0 0 0 0  0  0  0   0   0   0
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024

        32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 61
00000000000000000000000000101101
                   128 + 8 = 136
00000000000000000000000010001000
                        61 * 136
--------------------------------
                          = 8296
```
now lets try to represent 8296 in binary

cant? takes too much time?

well good thing we have computers then!

these things are extremely tedious, so lets write a function that will do it for us
```cpp
void base2(int in) {
    int out[12], i;
    for (i=0;in>0;i++) {
        out[i]=in % 2;
        in /= 2;
    }
    // we had declared i out of the for loop, so will not be deallocated on the stack
    for (int i-=1 ; i>=0; i--) {
        std::cout<<out[i];
    }
}
```
There we go!
now we understand two's compliment
