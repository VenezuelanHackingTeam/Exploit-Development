# Exploit POC's
Here is where I will throw my exploit POC's and explanations on concepts/techniques

I did not discover any of these(obviously) but they are extremely good practice


List of things I plan on adding
* Explain heap exploitation(tcache/UAF/unlink/overflow/grooming) and much much more
* Explain how memory works, process loading and execution within memory
* GOT/PLT Explanation
* Finish Return Oriented Programming explanation and challenges
* Format string explanation
* Explain modern linux stack protections like canary/PIE
* Explain ASLR on linux x64
* Explain memory mapping and virtual memory
* Finish exploit POC's
