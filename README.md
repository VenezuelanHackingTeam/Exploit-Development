### List of things I plan on adding
* Convert this repo into a gitbook so everything isnt so cluttered
* Explain heap exploitation(tcache/UAF/unlink/overflow/grooming) and much much more
* Explain and write a safer alternative to dlmalloc, ptmalloc, and etc..
* Explain how memory works, process loading and execution within memory
* Finish Return Oriented Programming explanation and challenges
* Format string explanation
* Explain modern linux stack protections like canary/PIE
* Explain ASLR on linux x64
* Explain memory mapping and virtual memory
* Finish exploit POC's
* Write a POC and writeup for CVE-2011-4130, an ftp UAF
* Complete writeup and POC of 1-day chakra-core bug
* Explanation and 1-day POC of v8 Out-Of-Bounds Write
