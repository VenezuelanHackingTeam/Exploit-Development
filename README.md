### List of things I plan on adding
* Explain heap exploitation(tcache/UAF/unlink/overflow/grooming) and much much more
* Explain and write a safer alternative to dlmalloc, ptmalloc, and etc..
* Explain how memory works, process loading and execution within memory
* GOT/PLT Explanation
* Finish Return Oriented Programming explanation and challenges
* Format string explanation
* Explain modern linux stack protections like canary/PIE
* Explain ASLR on linux x64
* Explain memory mapping and virtual memory
* Finish exploit POC's
* Write a POC and writeup for CVE-2011-4130, an ftp UAF

why?

i ask myself this question a lot, it just pops up in my head from time to time

why learn exploit development?
why slam your head against the wall day after day attempting to understand memory exploitation?
why not just follow in everybody else's footsteps and attack the much simpler web app?
Heres a list I created explaining my though process, a quick heads up, im not skilled in any sense of
that word, im not here to judge you, to put you below me, or to flex my superior interests, im just
a guy with an opinion, anyways, here goes.

1. You are unique, specialized, and valuable. There will always be a better web app pentester out
there, now that statement goes for exploit development as well, im not so niave to think that im 
going to be the best there ever was. I am just simply stating the fact that knowing, understanding, 
and taking the time to learn, play and create exploits is extremely unique. The majority will have 
given up and chosen to fuzz some directories or enter obscure obfuscated javascript into some input box
somewhere. If you decide to stick with exploit development, it will be exponentially harder, but you will
be much much more valuable. 
if you're good at it that is..

2. Power. im a retard so i love the thought of being powerful, and dangerous. That is the mindset
of a child, i am fully aware. Now you may be thinking, "haha little kid playing with linux binaries
haha who the fuck does he think he is?". I get that, the voice in my head tells me that too, im just
playing with miniature binaries that are basically meant to be exploitable, thats the least practical
thing anyones every heard of. At least with web app pentesting you are able to learn practical
knowledge right?

Wrong... kind of?

I will admit that 100 percent of all binary exploitation challenges are impractical, the only practical
thing about them is that they are practically useless. But thats not the point, the point was to LEARN
something, the point was to build on your knowledge of exploitation scenarios and techniques.
To allow you to stumble upon a vulnerability and have the capability to exploit it.
The point of binary exploitation(to me at least) is to be able to play with practical exploitation
scenarios with minimally sized binaries, without needing to fuzz for the vulnerability(some could see
as bad), on an easy to use operating system!

Even linux exploitation is worth it!, you might be thinking that ive gone insane but hear me out here.
To me, an 0day is an 0day, the recent sudo heap vulnerability was huge, it got everyones attention due
to the severity of it, and that was a linux exploit. No matter the operating system, no matter the
program, enviroment, or technique. Any exploit that allows arbitrary code execution will be powerful.

Now lets get back into why exploit development over web hacking?
Like i said, the main goal of everything is to get code execution right?
Web app are MUCH easier to get code execution out of, the difference in skill is drastically different!
if web is 50% easier than exploit development
and you can find for RCE's with half the time and half the effort then why learn exploit development??

One reason, and one reason only...

A target i am attempting to pwn will not be running a web server on their computer :)
Like i said, im a naive and incompetent child, i have the mindset of one as well, but thats just
how i think, this is my thought process.

Lets say for example, browser exploitation, that is a piece of (practically)exploitable software
Imagine what you could do, with a browser exploit, i, personally, have thought up a few scenarios:

1. Sell it, get rid of it in exchange for money, maybe zerodium, some shady third party, or a nation state

2. Use it in collaboration with some malware devs in china or russia, and distribute their malware with it

3. Hoard it, save it, keep it and maybe one day somebody will piss you off enough to the point where
you feel the need to unleash it

4. Be a good samaritan and either sell it to whichever company owns the software, or publicly release it
and their lawyers swarm you.


What im trying to get at, is that in terms of an exploit, it is essentially a nuclear weapon
Even if you were to achieve an RCE on a web server, given if they were a large enough corporation they
would have containerized the entire thing, built it all on docker or kubernetes, no way you'd be able
to walk away with anything. Their logs would pinpoint you before you even got the chance to enumerate

Would you rather learn how to make a weapon capable of taking on anything in the world, or learning how
to pierce the upper layer to a multi layered corporation, unable to do anything else but squirm?

Yea, doesnt sound so enticing does it?

3. Last and final reason, this one is the most important out of ALL OF THESE
it is fun, it is just plain and simple fun. I am having the most fun freaking out over some strange
behaviour that is going on within a binary. I enjoy that feeling of finally comprehending the
incomprehensible, it is the greatest feeling in the world. The main reason you should do something
is that you enjoy it, if you enjoy something, you will obviously find reasons in why that thing you
enjoy doing so much is superior to everything else. It is similar to people's favorite linux
distributions, when it comes down to it, there is literally no difference. It all just comes down to
reliability and preference, if you love doing something then do it, that is all.
