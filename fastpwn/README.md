# this is not an alternative to pwntools, just some optimizations that i had found when working with it. 

Pwntools is great, the best tool out there for binary exploitation. But we all agree that it is slow as all hell.
```
log             - pretty formatting optimized for speed - warning - info - debug ; 3 levels to log
cyclic          - Custom De Bruijn sequence
pack/unpack     - Python Struct Module
aslr            - read/write proc
gadgets         - custom algorithm to form ROP gadgets
```
I will not be creating anything that interacts directly with the binary. This will be left to the big
guns in paramiko, sockets, and pwntools. If I were to create a custom ssh, remote, and process handler
for binaries, it would not be able to work alongside pwntools.

I cannot say for certain that I will be able to deliver the best in stability, speed, and implemetation 
so I will leave it to pwntools. My only goal with this project is to optimize.

The gadgets module is a little special, as in this
case it is extremely unstable and experimental. It will first disassemble the binary provided, and run
a custom algorithm to detect rop gadgets. These gadgets are then placed within a list and checked to
see if it matches any templates.

For example, one template for a rop gadget is:
```
mov_gadget
pop_rax
pop_rdi
pop_rsi
pop_rdx
syscall

in this template, if we have all of the necessary gadgets within the binary, we will then begin to:
1. search for writeable regions in memory, will try .bss, then .data
2. write '/bin//sh' to writeable region, if x86 will split into 2 different writes
3. pop parameters depending on architecture, and pointer to '/bin//sh'
4. syscall and profit!
```
Obviously the point of this project is speed and optimization, so i will attempt to make everything
as fast as pythonly possible. haha get it? because python is dreadfully slow? haha.
